I'm Vox, a physics student with a bunch of weird interests. 

- I'm interested in theoretical and computational condensed-matter physics & complex mathematics.
- I love music and music theory.
- I've been fully running Linux since 2020.
- I'm a dragon enthusiast.

* Programming
I'm by no means a programming expert; I am somewhat comfortable with:
- Python
- Java
- MATLAB
And I've had basic introductions to:
- C++/C#
- Haskell

* Academics
- Received my Bachelor's in Physics in May 2024
- Began pursuing my PhD in Physics in August 2024!
